        No fixed product location. An inbound item goes to any free bin and the
        system records the exact bin — which is why a stow is invalid without
        both an item-scan and a location-scan.

        Allocation is a revocable, expiring claim — never a hard binding to one
        holding. A blocked pod or a short pick can always be re-satisfied
        elsewhere, so a failed delivery never strands an order.

        On-hand minus active reservations minus held or unlocated stock.
        Usable — not total — is what constrains release, and it is exposed
        explicitly rather than left for callers to derive.

        Unlocated. Cycle counting reconciles the two, and loss is never
        silent.
