# Domain model: ubiquitous language, aggregates, events, use cases

## Ubiquitous Language (use these exact names)

- **StockUnit** — a quantity of a SKU at a specific Bin. Every physical item
  has exactly one known bin OR is flagged Unlocated (lost). This is the core
  rule.
- **Bin / Location** — a coded slot. Chaotic storage: any SKU may occupy any
  free bin; capacity must not be exceeded.
- **Stow** — placing inbound stock into a bin. INVALID without BOTH an
  item-scan and a location-scan (this is precisely how inventory gets lost
  if skipped).
- **Usable inventory** — stock immediately available to fulfil (on-hand minus
  active reservations minus held/damaged). Usable, not total, is what
  constrains release. Expose this explicitly.
- **Reservation** — a REVOCABLE binding of a quantity to demand, with a
  timeout. Physical delivery can fail (pod blocked, tote lost, chute jam,
  short pick), so a reservation must be releasable and re-allocatable
  against a different holding.
- **Cycle count** — verify a bin's contents; reconcile discrepancies; may
  flag Unlocated.
- **ProductClassification** — SKU-level master data (independent of any
  bin): a closed set of `HandlingTag`s (`Hazmat`, `Fragile`,
  `TemperatureSensitive`, `Oversized`, `HighValue`) plus a `TemperatureClass`
  (`Ambient`/`Chilled`/`Frozen`), required only when `TemperatureSensitive`
  is set. This service is the source of truth. Unclassified SKUs carry no
  constraints (fail-open).
- **HandlingTag** — one of the five closed classification values above. Not
  an open tag set like `facility-layout`'s `LocationType` — these carry real
  regulatory/physical meaning, so the enum is deliberately closed.
- **DOTHazardClass** — an optional US DOT hazard class (1-9, grounded in
  49 CFR §177.848), meaningful only when `HandlingTag.Hazmat` is set but
  still OPTIONAL even then (nullable, for backward compat with
  already-classified hazmat SKUs that predate this field). Drives the
  same-bin segregation check below. See ADR-0010 (`docs/docs/adr/`) for the
  derived 9×9 class-level incompatibility matrix and its 4 documented
  simplification rules (division→class collapse, X-and-O both treated as
  incompatible for a single bin, Class 1 maximally restrictive, Class 9
  broadly compatible).

## Aggregates & invariants (enforce in domain, unit-tested)

- **StockUnit**: quantity >= 0; a stow requires item + location; state
  transitions Available -> Reserved -> Picked/Removed, or -> Unlocated. No
  negative usable.
- **Bin/Location**: sum(stock qty in bin) <= capacity; a full bin rejects
  stow.
- **Reservation**: reserved qty <= usable qty at reserve time; expires after
  timeout; revoke() returns quantity to usable; cannot double-consume.
- **ProductClassification**: `TemperatureSensitive` requires a non-empty,
  valid `TemperatureClass`; absence of `TemperatureSensitive` means
  `TemperatureClass` must be empty. `DOTHazardClass` (1-9) is optional even
  when `Hazmat` is set. `StowStock` enforces placement rules for classified
  SKUs by reading the target bin's zone attributes from `facility-layout`
  (Hazmat SKU requires a hazmat-rated zone; `TemperatureSensitive` SKU
  requires a matching zone `TemperatureClass`) — see ADR-0009. It ALSO
  enforces same-bin DOT segregation (ADR-0010): a hazmat SKU with a
  `DOTHazardClass` is rejected if the target bin already holds a SKU whose
  class is `Incompatible` per the 9×9 matrix — this check is purely LOCAL
  (StockRepo + ProductClassificationRepo, no cross-context call).
  **Fail-open** for unclassified SKUs, unknown/unmodeled bins, and
  unclassified occupants; **fail-closed** only when a classified SKU's zone
  lookup genuinely fails (`ErrLocationClassificationUnavailable`).
- Read models (usable-by-SKU, bin occupancy) are PROJECTIONS from events.

## Domain events (past tense)

StockReceived, ItemStowed, LocationRecorded, StockReserved,
ReservationExpired, ReservationRevoked, StockPicked, ItemUnlocated,
CycleCountCompleted, DiscrepancyDetected, ProductClassified — eleven total,
raised by four aggregates (StockUnit, Reservation, Bin/Location,
ProductClassification). Only **StockReserved** and **ReservationRevoked**
currently cross the service boundary via Kafka — see `integration-events.md`.

## Use cases (application layer)

1. `ReceiveStock(sku, qty)` -> staged stock awaiting stow
2. `StowStock(sku, qty, binId)` -> validates item+location scan, respects
   capacity, enforces hazmat/temperature placement rules AND same-bin DOT
   segregation for classified SKUs
3. `ReserveStock(sku, qty, demandRef)` -> revocable Reservation against
   usable
4. `RevokeReservation(reservationId)` -> returns qty to usable
5. `ConfirmPick(reservationId)` -> consumes reservation, StockPicked
6. `GetUsable(sku)` -> usable-inventory read model
7. `RunCycleCount(binId, countedQty)` -> reconcile, may raise
   Discrepancy/Unlocated
8. `ClassifyProduct(sku, handlingTags, temperatureClass?, dotHazardClass?)`
   -> registers/replaces a SKU's ProductClassification (this service is the
   source of truth)

## Design notes (from README)

- **Reservation is SKU-scoped, not bin-scoped.** `ReserveStock` draws from
  whichever `StockUnit`s have usable quantity (first-fit across bins) and
  records exactly which units/quantities it drew from as `Allocation`s on
  the `Reservation`. `RevokeReservation` returns quantity to those same
  units, but because a fresh `ReserveStock` call is free to draw from any
  unit with usable quantity, a subsequent reservation can be satisfied from
  a **different physical holding** — this is what makes a reservation
  revocable without stranding an order when a specific pick fails.
- **StockUnit lifecycle**: `AVAILABLE` -> `RESERVED` (any reserved quantity
  present) -> `PICKED` (physically removed, quantity remains) or `REMOVED`
  (quantity reached zero), or -> `UNLOCATED` (cycle count could not account
  for it). `Usable = on-hand - reserved`, and is zero for `UNLOCATED` /
  `REMOVED` units.
- **ReceiveStock does not create a `StockUnit`.** A `StockUnit` requires
  both a SKU and a Bin (item-scan + location-scan) by construction — that is
  the domain's stow-requires-both invariant. Receiving stages goods
  (publishes `StockReceived`) without persisting an aggregate; the durable
  record starts at `StowStock`.
- **Cycle count shortfall** marks whichever `StockUnit`s cover the shortfall
  fully `UNLOCATED` (not split into located/lost sub-quantities), publishing
  `ItemUnlocated` per unit touched, kept simple by design. An overage is
  reported as a `DiscrepancyDetected`/`CycleCountCompleted(discrepancy=true)`
  pair for a separate receiving/audit process to reconcile.

## One honest gap: nothing sweeps expirations yet

`ReservationExpired` and `Reservation.Expire()` exist in the domain and are
unit-tested, but **no use case calls `Expire()` and nothing publishes
`ReservationExpired` today** — there is no background sweeper. The timeout
is still enforced, just lazily and at a different point:

- `Reservation.Confirm(now)` returns `ErrExpired` past `expiresAt`, so a
  timed-out reservation can never be confirmed into a pick;
- a timed-out reservation's status remains `ACTIVE` in storage, so
  `RevokeReservation` still accepts it and returns its quantity to usable.

The practical consequence is that a reservation nobody revokes keeps holding
quantity out of usable until someone calls `DELETE /reservations/{id}`. A
sweeper that periodically expires and releases them is a real gap, listed
here rather than papered over.
