// GetReservationsByDemandRef looks up every Reservation aggregate ever
// created against a given demand reference (an external system's order+line
// reference, e.g. from order-management). A demandRef can have multiple
// reservations across its lifetime — one revoked, a retry that succeeded —
// so the result is a slice of domain aggregates, not a single value or a DTO
// (DTOs are the HTTP adapter's concern, not this layer's).
//
// This is the service's read path for a reservation by demand reference, so
// it is where LAZY expiry is enforced: any ACTIVE result whose timeout has
// elapsed is transitioned to Expired, has its allocated quantity returned to
// usable, and raises ReservationExpired — all before the (now-current)
// results are returned to the caller. Stock/Events/Clock are required for
// this; a nil Clock would panic, matching this codebase's convention of not
// defending against a mis-wired composition root.
