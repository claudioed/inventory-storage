Feature: Cycle count
  A Cycle count verifies a Bin's contents against system records and
  reconciles discrepancies. A shortfall means the physical item is no longer
  known to be at that Bin, so it is flagged Unlocated.

  Background:
    Given an empty warehouse
    And a Bin "C-1-1" with capacity 20
    And 8 units of SKU "SKU-C" are Stowed into Bin "C-1-1"

  @bdd
  Scenario: A cycle count matching expected quantity reports no discrepancy
    When I run a Cycle count on Bin "C-1-1" with counted quantity 8
    Then the response status is 200
    And the Cycle count reports system quantity 8 and counted quantity 8
    And the Cycle count reports no discrepancy
    And the domain event "CycleCountCompleted" was published
    And the Usable inventory for SKU "SKU-C" is 8

  @bdd
  Scenario: A cycle count mismatch is flagged as a discrepancy
    When I run a Cycle count on Bin "C-1-1" with counted quantity 5
    Then the response status is 200
    And the Cycle count reports system quantity 8 and counted quantity 5
    And the Cycle count reports a discrepancy
    And the domain event "DiscrepancyDetected" was published
    And the domain event "ItemUnlocated" was published
    And the Usable inventory for SKU "SKU-C" is 0
